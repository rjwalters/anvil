"""Doc-coverage smoke tests for the ``proposal-revise --polish "<reason>"`` flag.

Per issue #862, ``proposal-revise`` adopts the generic operator-directed
revision contract already codified in ``anvil/lib/snippets/directed_revision.md``
and shipped by ``memo`` (the original consumer, issue #201) and ``primer``
(the report-family — review+audit — adoption, issue #691). This module pins
the **documented contract** in ``proposal-revise.md`` + ``SKILL.md``: cheap
"grep-the-doc" regression guards that the required-reason rejection prose,
the step-4-only bypass scope, and the ``metadata.revision_mode`` /
``metadata.revise_force_reason`` audit-trail field names stay documented and
don't drift back to the pre-#862 "delete a verdict or hand-edit
``_progress.json``" workaround prose.

These tests assert on substring presence and structural ordering only —
they do NOT validate prose quality and they do NOT execute the reviser.
The reviser is LLM-driven, so behavioural assertions belong in
consumer-side integration tests, not here.

Per-skill test filename convention (#58): this file is named with a
``test_proposal_`` prefix so it never collides with the
``test_revise_polish_flag`` shape another skill might pick (see
``tests/skills/memo/test_memo_revise_polish_flag.py`` for the sibling
convention this module mirrors).
