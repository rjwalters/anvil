"""Doc-coverage tests for the singleton-class overflow resolution path
(issue #965).

Background: `deck-review`'s post-render `auto_shrink_detector` is a
**peer-relative** rule — it needs `min_peers_per_class` (default 3) pages
in a `_class:` to compute a median, so a singleton class (the one `title`
slide, the one `ask` slide) is recorded in `skipped_classes` and never
flagged. That is the deliberate D4 tautology contract pinned by
`TestF3_SingletonClassNeverFlagged` in `test_auto_shrink_detector.py`,
and it stays. Its consequence is a hole in the "unified gate" contract
(`deck-review.md` step 5c, issue #562): a source-side
`slide-content-overflow` **error** on a singleton-class slide blocks
advance with nothing post-render able to confirm or refute it, leaving
the operator with a manual look at the rendered PDF — the exact step the
gate exists to eliminate.

Issue #965 closes that hole by **documenting the sanctioned resolution**
(Option B in the issue) rather than by adding a peerless absolute-margin
signal to the detector (Option A, considered and rejected — see the
`test_review_records_why_absolute_floor_was_rejected` case below). The
named cross-check is `deck-vision`'s v1 `vertical_overflow`, which reads
the rendered PNG with a VLM: it is an automated critic pass rather than a
human hand-confirm, and it is not defeated by the background image that
saturates the pixel-bbox detector on exactly this slide shape.

Acceptance criteria asserted here:

1. `deck-review.md` step 5c names the singleton carve-out, defines the
   `uncrosscheckable_singletons` list, and states it does NOT change
   `critical_flag`.
2. `deck-review.md` records WHY an absolute-margin floor was rejected, so
   the design decision is not re-litigated.
3. `deck-review.md`'s `_summary.md` and `findings.md` templates both
   carry the new surface.
4. `deck-revise.md` step 7c carries the reviser playbook, with fixing the
   slide as the first resort and a MANDATORY vision citation on the
   escape-hatch branch.
5. `deck-revise.md`'s `_revision-log.md` worked example carries the
   resolutions table.
6. The path is discoverable from both ends — the review command that
   raises the error and the revise command that acts on it — plus the
   reciprocal pointer in `deck-vision.md`.
7. Neither command sanctions a manual look at the rendered PDF.

Substring-presence only, distinct filename
(`test_deck_singleton_overflow_resolution_doc.py`) per the #58 packaging
convention.
