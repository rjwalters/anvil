# ip-uspto-101 — §101 critic

**Role**: §101 statutory subject matter critic.
**Reads**: latest `<thread>.{N}/spec.tex` + `<thread>.{N}/claims.tex`.
**Writes**: `<thread>.{N}.s101/` with `_summary.md`, `findings.md`, `_meta.json`, `_progress.json`.

The s101 sibling is **read-only once written**. Critical flags from this critic short-circuit convergence regardless of total score.

## Background — Alice/Mayo two-step

Under 35 U.S.C. § 101, a claim is patent-eligible only if it is directed to a process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter — and not to an abstract idea, natural phenomenon, or law of nature. The Supreme Court's *Alice* / *Mayo* framework structures the analysis:

- **Step 1**: Is the claim directed to a judicial exception (abstract idea, natural phenomenon, or law of nature)?
  - "Abstract idea" categories per USPTO MPEP 2106.04(a)(2): (a) mathematical concepts, (b) certain methods of organizing human activity, (c) mental processes.
  - If NO → claim is patent-eligible. Done.
  - If YES → proceed to Step 2.
- **Step 2**: Does the claim recite additional elements that amount to "significantly more" than the judicial exception itself?
  - Generic computer implementation of an abstract idea is NOT enough.
  - Well-understood, routine, conventional activity is NOT enough.
  - An inventive concept, an improvement to computer functionality, a specific transformation of an article — these CAN be enough.
  - If YES → claim is patent-eligible.
  - If NO → claim is **not** patent-eligible (potential §101 rejection).

This critic runs the Alice/Mayo analysis on each independent claim and reports findings.

## Inputs

- **Thread slug** (positional argument).
- **Latest version directory**: highest `N` with `<thread>.{N}/claims.tex`.
- **Rubric**: `anvil/skills/ip-uspto/rubric.md` (dimension 4 + §101 critical-flag policy).

## Outputs

```
<thread>.{N}.s101/
  _summary.md       Critic tag s101, critical flag, dimension 4 score, top revision priorities
  findings.md       Per-claim Alice/Mayo analysis with severity ratings
  _meta.json        { critic, role, started, finished, model, schema_version }
  _progress.json    Phase state for the s101 critic
```

## Procedure

1. **Discover state**: highest `N` with `<thread>.{N}/claims.tex`. Idempotence check on `_progress.json`.
2. **Resume check**: delete partial output from a crashed run.
3. **Initialize `_progress.json`**.
4. **Read inputs**: `spec.tex` (for context on what the invention claims to do) and `claims.tex` (the objects of analysis).
5. **Parse independent claims**: extract each independent claim (claims that do not depend on another claim).
6. **For each independent claim, run Alice/Mayo Step 1**:
   - Is the claim directed to a judicial exception?
   - Classify: not directed to an exception | abstract idea (specify category) | natural phenomenon | law of nature.
   - If not directed to an exception, score this claim as `pass`, finding severity `none`.
   - If directed to an exception, proceed to Step 2.
7. **For each Step-1-positive claim, run Alice/Mayo Step 2**:
   - Does the claim recite additional elements amounting to "significantly more"?
   - Look for: an inventive concept, a specific improvement to computer functionality (Enfish, McRO patterns), a specific transformation of an article, a particular machine, integration into a practical application that effects an improvement.
   - If YES → score this claim as `pass`, finding severity `minor` (note the Step-1 exception for the record but no action needed).
   - If NO → score this claim as `fail`, finding severity `critical` and SET CRITICAL FLAG.
8. **Score Dimension 4 (0–5)**:
   - All independent claims pass cleanly (no Step 1 positives, or all Step 2 positives with strong justification): **5**.
   - All independent claims pass but some required Step 2 rescue: **4**.
   - Most claims pass; one claim is on weak Step 2 footing without being a critical flag: **3**.
   - One or more claims fail; critical flag set: **0–2** (typically score 2 if other claims are strong, 0 if all are problematic).
9. **Identify critical flags**:
   - Any claim that fails Alice/Mayo Step 2 → set `flagged: true`.
   - A pure software claim reciting only generic computer components performing well-understood, routine, conventional activity → set `flagged: true`.
   - A claim that recites a mathematical formula without a specific practical application → set `flagged: true`.
10. **Write `_summary.md`**:

    ```markdown
    ---
    critic: s101
    for_version: <N>
    flagged: <true|false>
    score_d4: <0-5 or null if structurally inapplicable>

    # §101 summary — <thread>.<N>

    | # | Dimension | Weight | Score | Justification |
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    | 1 | Claim breadth & dependency | 5 | null | n/a — see claims critic |
    | 2 | §112(a) written description | 5 | null | n/a — see s112 critic |
    | 3 | §112(b) definiteness | 5 | null | n/a — see s112 critic |
    | 4 | §101 statutory subject matter | 5 | 3 | Claim 1 passes; claim 9 is on weak Step 2 footing (Enfish-style improvement asserted but spec evidence thin). |
    | 5 | Novelty positioning | 5 | null | n/a — see priorart critic |
    | 6 | Specification completeness | 5 | null | n/a — see reviewer |
    | 7 | Drawing-text correspondence | 5 | null | n/a — see reviewer |
    | 8 | Formal compliance | 5 | null | n/a — see reviewer |

    **Critical flag**: <none | claim 9 fails Alice Step 2 — see findings>

    **Top revision priorities** (if any):
    1. Strengthen the §101 hook for claim 9 by adding a specific implementation detail from BRIEF §4.
    2. ...
    ```

11. **Write `findings.md`** with one finding per analyzed claim. Format:

    ```markdown
    ### Finding 1 — Claim 1 §101 analysis

    - **Severity**: `none` (passes Alice Step 1)
    - **Location**: `claims.tex` claim 1
    - **Rationale**: The claim is directed to a tangible apparatus comprising specific structural elements; not a judicial exception. Step 1 negative.
    - **Suggested fix**: none.

    ### Finding 2 — Claim 9 §101 analysis

    - **Severity**: `critical`
    - **Location**: `claims.tex` claim 9
    - **Rationale**: The claim recites a method comprising steps that can be performed mentally and using a generic computer to display the result. This is an abstract idea (mental process) under Step 1. The recited "displaying the result on a display" is well-understood, routine, conventional activity and does not amount to significantly more under Step 2.
    - **Suggested fix**: Either (a) narrow the claim to recite a specific technical improvement to computer functionality (e.g., a new data structure or algorithm that improves computational efficiency, with spec support), or (b) integrate the method into a practical application that effects a transformation (e.g., applying the result to control a physical actuator).
    ```

12. **Write `_meta.json`** and finalize `_progress.json`.
13. **Report**: print the path and a one-line status (e.g., `s101: acme-widget.2.s101/ → score=3, FLAGGED (claim 9 fails Step 2)`).

## Idempotence and resumability

Standard: completed `_summary.md` is never overwritten; crashed runs re-runnable after cleanup.

## Notes for the s101 agent

- **Be calibrated, not paranoid.** Most apparatus claims pass Step 1 cleanly. Step 1 positives are concentrated in software, business method, and diagnostic method claims.
- **MPEP 2106 is the authoritative guide.** When uncertain, defer to MPEP 2106's worked examples. Hypotheticals from your own training should defer to MPEP.
- **A Step 2 rescue requires spec support.** Do not credit a Step 2 argument that the spec does not back up. If the claim asserts "improves computer functionality" but the spec says nothing about it, that is a critical flag.
- **Critical flag is consequential.** Setting `flagged: true` blocks convergence. Set it only when you would refuse to file the application as-is on §101 grounds. False positives waste a revision iteration.
- **Method claims and pure-software claims deserve the most attention.** Apparatus and composition claims rarely have §101 issues. Spend your budget where the risk is.
